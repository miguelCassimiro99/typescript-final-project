<h3 align="center">A Typescript course by Alura (Part III)</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This project was used to complement the content of the two previous parts, applying best practices and concepts of OOP to implements a system that simulates a behavior of Vue, Angular or React on limited mode.
    It consists on a simple form to register a order and search for order on an API inside the project.
    When you register or search for them, a table is istant rendered on page without reload the content (reactive).

    A special thanks to Alura and to the teacher for the content of this course.
